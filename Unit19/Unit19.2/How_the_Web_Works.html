            <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server.</li>
            <li>Short for Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some internet resource.</li>
            <li>Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.</li>
            <li>The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format <strong>?key1=value1&key2=value2...</strong></li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)</li>
                    <li>POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol (eg a request for HTML from news.google.com)</li>
            <li>An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)</li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:</li>
                    <li>Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control.</li>
                    <li>Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS.</li>
                    <li>Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things).</li>
                    <li>The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)).</li>
                    <li>The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc).</li>
                    <li>The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
