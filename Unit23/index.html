    <H1>The Big WHY.</H1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
    <li>
        My big why to change in career is not that big, my goal has always been to create something to help people, and the one that was the most apparent to me is game design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Who do I work for, I work for myself and those around me whom are with in my grasp or influnce, I want to be a person to help others and my skills in Front end design will help me achieve making a game or app to help others in positive ways that I might not have intended to do so.
    </li>
    <li>
        My stregths well I am persistent and I try hard not to give up. I try to figure things out piece by piece and look at it in muliple perspectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        What motivates me, that is an interesting question for me its hard to anwser with a simple "my family or friends" for me it is an ever evolving reason, yes family and friends do help but it is more than that and I lack the right words to discribe what it is but it does drive me forward.
    </li>
    <li>
        What do I like about myself, I do not have an anwser for that question.
    </li>
    <li>
        What I value most, is hard to say the old proverb "Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder" is the best anwser I can give, the next would be "One mans Garbage is anothers Tresaure"
    </li>
    <li>
        I find my "flow", when I find the rtyhem within myself and place myself in a trace like state. I feel comfortable and consistent.
    </li>
    <li>
        What can I contribute to the world, I do not have an anwser for that due to the fact that the world is consistent in changing what could be medicine today could be poison tomorrow, with the ever ebing and flowing of the world something that can be considered a contribute is more a view of did it help at that time.
    </li>
